## Final Results
### 3 Algorithms were run: 1- Decision Tree, KNN without PCA and KNN with PCA. The best model is KNN without PCA which has a calssification accuracy of .988 with zero false positive or negatives expect for in 3 cases the Adelie penguin wereclassified as Chinstrap. ( See confusion matrix)
